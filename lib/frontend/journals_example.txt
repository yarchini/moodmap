Title: Unopened moments
The cafe on the corner had changed ownership again. The scent of freshly brewed coffee still lingered, 
but the pastries in the display case looked untouched. A familiar tune played softly from the speakers, 
one I hadn’t heard in years. At the counter, the barista hesitated before handing me the cup, her eyes flickering 
to my hands. The drink was slightly cooler than usual when I took the first sip.
Outside, the street was busier than usual. A couple walked by, their conversation overlapping with the distant sound 
of a car horn. A child tugged at their parent’s sleeve, pointing at something across the road. The wind picked up, 
pushing a crumpled receipt against my shoe. I bent down to pick it up, only to let it slip through my fingers as a 
passing bus sent a gust of air through the sidewalk.
At home, the mail sat unopened on the table. A single envelope stood out from the rest, the return address unfamiliar. 
The clock on the wall ticked steadily, its rhythm unchanged. The pages of the book on my nightstand remained where I 
had left them last week.

Title: Unfinished Conversations
The cafe was quieter than usual. A half-filled cup of coffee sat across from me, its steam fading into the air. 
The chair remained empty, but I still glanced up whenever the door chimed. The waiter passed by, collecting plates and 
cups with practiced efficiency, his footsteps blending into the low hum of conversation.
Outside, the bus pulled away from the stop, leaving behind a woman adjusting the strap of her bag. 
She checked her watch twice before sighing and stepping back under the awning. A group of students laughed as they crossed the street,
their voices carrying over the sound of passing cars.The book beside me stayed closed, its cover worn at the edges. 
My fingers traced the folded corner of a page I never finished reading.The phone on the table vibrated once, then stilled. 
I let it be.

Title: Sunlit Afternoons
The park was alive with laughter today. Children ran barefoot across the grass, their kites tugging at the wind. A dog, 
tongue hanging lazily, trotted beside its owner, stopping only to chase a drifting leaf. The scent of freshly cut grass mixed 
with the sugary aroma of a nearby ice cream cart.I found a bench under a wide oak tree, its shade cool against the warmth of the 
afternoon. A couple sat nearby, sharing a cone, their quiet conversation punctuated by bursts of laughter. Somewhere in the distance, 
a street musician strummed his guitar, the melody floating through the air like a forgotten song. The book in my lap lay open, 
though I had barely read a word. The sun peeked through the leaves, scattering golden patches 
across the pages. I closed my eyes for a moment, listening to the world move around me light, easy, unhurried.
